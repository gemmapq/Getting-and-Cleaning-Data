# The script works as follows:

# 1. Merges the training and test sets into one data set.
# 2. Extracts the measurements containing mean and std for each measurement.
# 3. Uses the descriptive activity names to replace the activities code
# 4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
# 5. Creates a tidy data set using aggregate() with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
